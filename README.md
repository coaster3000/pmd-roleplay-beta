# PMD-Roleplay Site Beta Userscript File
A userscript containing beta features of the PMD-roleplay.forumotion.org site.
## Installation
You must have an extension on your webbrowser that supports userscripts. This was developed and tested on Tampermonkey, which is a fork of greasemonkey for Chrome.

Usually, if you have these extensions installed. You may install the script simply by visiting the script source. This will open up the extension and display the scripts meta information and give you an option to install it.
